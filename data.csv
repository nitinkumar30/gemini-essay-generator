Our community faces a persistent problem: litter. It can be seen everywhere, from the school ground to the neighborhood streets. This is not just a problem of esthetics, but also poses serious health risks and degrades our enviroment.

The main reason behind the littering is the lack of awareness and responsibility among some individuals. Many people simply don't take their trashes seriously and discard them wherever its convenience. This careless behaviour has consequences, potentially affecting our local aquatic resources.

To combat this issue, our school should implement a multi-pronged apporach. We could organize regular clean-up drives and educational programs emphasizing the importance of responsible waste management. Also, installing more bins in accessible location can encourage better waste disposal habits. By working together, we can make a cleaner, healthier enviroment for everybody.

Our neighborhood is plagued by a persistent problem: littering. It's a sorry sight to witness plastic bottles, wrappers, and other debris strewn across our streets and parks. This is not just an eye sore, it also poses serious environmental and health hazards.

Firstly, Litter contaminates our water and soil. Secondly, it attracts pests and spreads disease. The current situation is simply unaccaptable, especially when we consider the impact on our community.

To combat this issue, I propose a multi-pronged approach. We need more trash cans strategically placed throughout the neighbourhood and school. Frequent trash pick-up services should be scheduled. Additionally, a comprehensive awareness campaign emphasizing the importance of keeping our enviroment clean.

This solution is vital. A cleaner neighborhood is not only a more pleasant place to live, but also contributes to a healthier and more sustainable community for all of us. Let us take the initiative to protect our enviroment!

I suggest we start a weekly cleanup drive, leaded by the students and supported by the local council. We can divide the neighborhood into sections, each with a team. Regular garbage collection and awareness campaign are also needed to educate people for proper disposal. This will help to solve this problem and make our neighborhood clean.
